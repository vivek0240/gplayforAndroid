The Aroma package is a special version of the regular [['Super'|Package-Comparison]] package, but with a graphical front-end that will allow you to select which specific applications to install (or not) without having to manually write a [[gapps-config file|Advanced-Features-and-Options]]. Note: For versions of 5.0 and lower the Aroma package is based on Stock, and not all options shown are actually available within the package.
This package has a [dedicated thread at XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/general/open-gapps-aroma-installer-t3010798).
