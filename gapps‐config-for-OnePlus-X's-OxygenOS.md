The main purpose of this specific gapps-config for OnePlus X's OxygenOS is to remove the stock GApps and reinstall them using Open GApps packages (stock or higher) and also to offer you the chance to install only those Google Apps that you want on your device.

You can personalize this gapps-config to meet your demands. To do so please read [Advanced Features and Options](https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps/wiki/Advanced-Features-and-Options).

* Google removed the `Trusted Face` (FaceUnlock) feature for security reasons (see [this post](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/04/trusted-face-smart-unlock-method-has-been-removed-from-android-devices/)). We've removed the corresponding code for the `FaceDetect` and `FaceUnlock` for all platforms.

This gapps-config is organized in 2 steps:

**\#1** - Remove stock GApps

**\#2** - Install Open GApps (the exact same apps to replicate the stock installation)

I highly suggest to not remove any keywords from step #1. If you remove any of those, after the installation APK conflicts can occur.

At step #2 you can remove the keywords corresponding to which Google Apps you don't want to be installed, or even add more keywords. The keywords tagged with _#Safe to remove_ are indeed safe to be removed (not essential apps). An example of an essential app is Google Play Music, because it is the only music player included as default in OxygenOS. Of course you can add, remove, replace any keyword to meet your demands.

**IMPORTANT**

**!**This script **requires** at least the **stock package**! If you will use smaller packages you will miss some of the Google Apps!

**!**Before flashing you may want to backup your system partition in case something goes wrong.

**!**This gapps-config was written specifically for OPX's OxygenOS to remove the stock gapps and reinstall them. On AOSP-based ROMs you won't need this specific gapps-config!
